        View changes implemented for the v2 release
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    For customers moving from the previous release, this section describes some
    of the basic changes you should consider for the new version of the APIs.
</p>
<h2 id="no-session-token">No Session Token</h2>
<p>
    Previously, to use Flex APIs, a
    <code class="inline-code">/v1/location/getsessiontoken</code> request must
    be made to acquire a session token that tracks the session and maps all
    calls made during the session. The Request Body needed to include a
    <code class="inline-code">LocationID</code> and
    <code class="inline-code">CustomerCode</code>. The request returned the
    <code class="inline-code">SessionToken</code> to be included in the Request
    Body of all future API calls made during the session.
</p>
<p>
    There is no longer a need to request a session token. The
    <code class="inline-code">access_token</code>, included as the
    <code class="inline-code">bearer_token</code> in Authorization Headers, now
    contains the required information to map your API calls during the session.
    The <code class="inline-code">access_token</code> contains application
    registration details including the application name that contains the
    <code class="inline-code">CustomerCode</code>. Certain roles assigned to
    that <code class="inline-code">CustomerCode</code> govern the allowed
    interactions with Flex APIs.
</p>
<h2 id="subscribe-request-changes">Subscribe Request Changes</h2>
<p>
    In V1, the response after sending a
    <code class="inline-code">/v1/location/subscribe</code> request included a
    <code class="inline-code">locationCapabilityList</code> with a list of
    devices at the location and their statues. In V2, the
    <code class="inline-code">/session/v2/subscriptions</code> request
    <em>only returns Service Bus details</em> for the new subscription.
</p>
<p>
    The Service Bus details are largely the same, except some of the property
    names are different.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        There is a new <code class="inline-code">Subscription ID</code> that is
        Flex-specific and must be included in all requests connecting to and
        interacting with devices.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <code class="inline-code">serviceBusSharedAccessToken</code> is now
        contained within the
        <code class="inline-code">attachmentstring</code> that holds all
        information required for Azure to validate you have access to the Azure
        Service Bus.
    </li>
    <li>
        The property <code class="inline-code">serviceBusTopic</code> has
        replaced <code class="inline-code">topicName</code> and has a fixed
        value of <code class="inline-code">airline-messages</code> in all
        situations.
    </li>
    <li>
        The property <code class="inline-code">subscriptionName</code> has
        replaced <code class="inline-code">serviceBusSubscription</code> and is
        a GUID returned per subscription.
    </li>
    <li>
        Both properties <code class="inline-code">serviceBusTopic</code> and
        <code class="inline-code">subscriptionName</code> are identifiers to
        tell your application which specific channel it should read Service Bus
        messages.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-reservation-endpoint">New Reservation Endpoint</h2>
<p>
    The new <span class="method post">POST</span>
    <code class="inline-code">/site/v2/reservations</code> request limits use of
    a location to the application backend with a specific customer code that
    made the request. The application backend must reserve the location to make
    use of its devices.
</p>
<h2 id="no-device-status-request">No Device Status Request</h2>
<p>
    There is a no longer a
    <code class="inline-code">/v1/location/status/</code> request available to
    return device statuses at a location. Instead, when you connect to a device,
    a <code class="inline-code">DeviceStatus</code> message is displayed on the
    Service Bus that indicates the device status. When the device status changes
    in some cases, a new message is sent.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <code class="inline-code">/session/v2/locations/{locationId}</code> returns
    a list of devices and their capabilities, but not their statuses.
</p>
<h2 id="connect-not-reserve">Connect, not Reserve</h2>
<p>
    The V1 <span class="method post">POST</span>
    <code class="inline-code">/v1/device/reserve</code> request should not be
    confused with the new
    <code class="inline-code">/site/v2/reservations</code> endpoint, they are
    unrelated. Previously, the purpose of reserving a device was to connect to
    it. The new <code class="inline-code">/site/v2/reservations</code> endpoint
    is about reserving a location for exclusive access to its devices.
</p>
<p>
    Instead of connecting to a device through a
    <span class="method post">POST</span>
    <code class="inline-code">/v1/device/reserve</code> request, you now connect
    to a device by making a <span class="method post">POST</span>
    <code class="inline-code">/session/v2/attachments</code> request. The
    outcome of the request is the same, to connect to a device to send and
    receive messages.
</p>
<p>
    Instead of passing a <code class="inline-code">LocatorList</code> value to
    identify the device, the IoT Hub identifier
    <code class="inline-code">deviceID</code> is passed.
</p>
<h2 id="deviceid-instead-of-locator">DeviceID instead of Locator</h2>
<p>
    The IoT Hub identifier <code class="inline-code">deviceID</code> is now used
    in requests instead of <code class="inline-code">Locator</code>.
</p>
<h2 id="no-transactionid-or-requestid">No TransactionID or RequestID</h2>
<p>
    In V1, the <code class="inline-code">TransactionId</code> property was
    required to pair certain kinds of requests with responses on the Service
    Bus. In addition, certain requests also required a
    <code class="inline-code">RequestId</code> used by the API to ensure that
    duplicate messages are not processed.
</p>
<p>Both these properties are no longer required.</p>
<h2 id="no-enable-or-disable-devices">No Enable or Disable Devices</h2>
<p>
    Previously, devices needed to be enabled to indicate the application is
    ready to receive data via reading or scanning and disabled to stop the flow
    of information from the device to the application.
</p>
<p>
    You no longer need to Enable or Disable devices, except for scan devices.
    Enable is now <span class="method post">POST</span>
    <code class="inline-code">/scan/v2/startscanning</code> and Disable is now
    <span class="method post">POST</span>
    <code class="inline-code">/scan/v2/stopscanning</code>. The
    <code class="inline-code">/scan/v2/startscanning</code> request readies the
    device to start scanning documents.
</p>
<h2 id="no-legacyprint-command-request">No Legacy Print Command Request</h2>
<p>
    While it is possible to send an Legacy format print request, there is no
    longer the ability to send Legacy Print commands to a device to handle the
    whole device interaction in your application as was possible previously.
</p>
