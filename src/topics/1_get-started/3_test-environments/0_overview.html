<h1 id="test-environments">Test Environments</h1>
<p>
    To enable you to test your applications on a representative environment, you
    are provided access to one of the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>SITA Flex &quot;Suitcase</strong>&quot; - contains all the
        devices and software required to develop your application against the
        SITA Flex APIs. This will have been physically shipped to your location
        to allow you to use the Flex environment.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Citrix Virtualized SITA Flex Environment</strong> - a set of VMs
        that have been configured in the Flex Environment with a Device
        Simulator that will behave like real hardware devices in a SITA Flex
        suitcase. You access this environment over the internet with credentials
        provided to you as part of application registration.
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> The Citrix Virtualized SITA Flex Environment is
        provided if shipping a suitcase is determined to be problematic. For
        example, duration of shipping, import rules, damage to the suitcase or
        devices in shipping, or device availability.
    </p>
