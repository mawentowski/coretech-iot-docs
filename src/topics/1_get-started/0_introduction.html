    The SITA Flex Platform is a collection of cloud APIs that allow airport and
    airline application developers to
    <strong>build fully mobile, passenger service applications</strong> either
    on or off-airport while maintaining
    <strong>full common-use compatibility</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    SITA Flexâ€™s goal is to facilitate the transition from legacy applications to
    mobile passenger service and workforce solutions that offer more customer
    engagement and opportunities to reduce costs and generate more revenue.
