<h2 id="flex-environments">Flex Environments</h2>
<p>Flex has two environments available for airlines to use:</p>
<h3 id="staging">Staging</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        The staging environment is configured and deployed with the same
        resources as production and so provides an experience akin to using the
        production environment.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is the staging environment that most Airline Proof of Concepts (PoCs)
        will use when connecting to Flex.
    </li>
    <li>
        The virtual test locations and Flex suitcases exist within the staging
        environment.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="production">Production</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        This is the production environment for Flex where live airport locations
        are configured.
    </li>
    <li>
        Airline production software will use the Flex production environment for
        real-world airport operations.
    </li>
</ul>
