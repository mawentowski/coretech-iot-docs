    Customers have a certain degree of freedom when it comes to setting up their
    applications to use Flex APIs.
</p>
<h3 id="airline-backends">Airline Backends</h3>
<p>
    An airline backend is the server/data center that communicates with Flex. An
    airline may choose to have a single backend that services multiple
    applications, or multiple backends to service multiple applications. For
    example, an airline may have an airline backend for a passenger-facing
    mobile app and another for a desktop app for agents.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <strong>Tip:</strong> While possible to have a single backend servicing
        multiple apps, it is more common to having separate airline backends for
        each app. Ultimately, it is for the airline to determine the best
        approach.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Once again, whether an airline backend manages one or multiple applications,
    each application has its own set of credentials.
</p>
<h3 id="subscriptions">Subscriptions</h3>
<p>
    Because the Service Bus is Azure Region-specific, each airline backend must
    maintain one subscription <u>for each Azure Region</u>. For any one Azure
    Region, all messages sent from devices in that region display on that
    region&#39;s subscription.
</p>
<p>
    A subscription is created when an airline backend sends a POST
    <code>session/v2/subscriptions</code> request.
</p>
<h3 id="client-applications">Client Applications</h3>
<p>
    Airline backends should be designed to service thousands of clients. Flex
    does not interact with any client applications, only the airline backends
    that service those clients. If a client application requests to print a
    boarding pass, it is the responsibility of the backend to send the response
    back to the device that made the request (e.g., &quot;Print
    Successful&quot;). In other words, the airline backend must be able to pair
    requests with responses and handle the overall interaction with its client
    applications.
