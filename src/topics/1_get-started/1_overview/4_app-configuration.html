        Determine the best approach for how your app should be configured to use
        CoreTech APIs
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    Customers have a certain degree of freedom when it comes to setting up their
    applications to use CoreTech APIs.
</p>
<h2 id="airline-backends">Backends</h2>
<p>
    An application backend is the server/data center that communicates with
    CoreTech APIs. An airline may choose to have a single backend that services
    multiple applications, or multiple backends to service multiple
    applications. For example, an airline may have an application backend for a
    consumer-facing mobile app and another for a desktop app for attendants.
</p>

<div class="alert-section info-alert">
    <div class="">
        While possible to have a single backend servicing multiple apps, it is
        more common to having separate application backends for each app.
        Ultimately, it is for the airline to determine the best approach.
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    Once again, whether an application backend manages one or multiple
    applications, each application has its own set of credentials.
</p>
<h2 id="linkages">Linkages</h2>
<p>
    Because the IoT Message Service is Message Service Region-specific, each
    application backend must maintain one linkage
    <u>for each Message Service Region</u>. For any one Message Service Region,
    all messages sent from devices in that region display on that region's
    linkage.
</p>

<div class="alert-section info-alert">
    <div class="">
        A linkage is created when an application backend sends a
        <span class="method post">POST</span
        ><code class="inline-code"> sync/v2/linkages</code> request.
    </div>
</div>

<h2 id="client-applications">Client Applications</h2>
<p>
    Backends should be designed to service thousands of clients. CoreTech APIs
    doe not interact with any client applications, only the application backends
    that service those clients. If a client application requests to print a
    entry pass, it is the responsibility of the backend to send the response
    back to the device that made the request (e.g.,
    <code class="inline-code">Print Successful</code>).
</p>

<p>
    In other words, the application backend must be able to pair requests with
    responses and handle the overall interaction with its client applications.
