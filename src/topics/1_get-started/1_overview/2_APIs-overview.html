<blockquote>
    <p>
        <strong>Note</strong>: The endpoints below describe the use of devices
        to perform certain actions like printing or scanning. For an in-depth

<h3 id="session-api">Session API</h3>
<p>
    The <a href="Session API_1.htm">Session API</a> endpoints allow your airline
    backend to connect to devices configured in the SITA Flex environment so it
    can receive messages from those devices.
</p>
<p>
    When using this API, you must <strong>subscribe</strong> to the Azure
    Service Bus, <strong>reserve</strong> a location for exclusive access, then
    create a <strong>connection</strong> to Flex devices to receive messages on
    the subscription.
</p>
<p>Example locations configured in the SITA Flex environment include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Airport CUTE type workstations for check-in and boarding</li>
    <li>CUSS Type devices such as a Self-Service Kiosk</li>
    <li>Self-Service BagDrop and Self-Service Boarding Gate</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="print-api">Print API</h3>
