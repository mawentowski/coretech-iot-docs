<h3 id="high-level-use-cases">High-Level Use Cases</h3>
<p>SITA Flex is for airports or airlines:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Who wish to
        <strong>leverage mobile apps to engage the customer</strong> and require
        their applications to have full, conventional common-use compatibility.
    </li>
    <li>
        Who need to <strong>scale their operation up or down</strong>
        <strong>easily</strong> with the ability increase capacity and implement
        off-airport passenger processing (including bags, etc.).
    </li>
    <li>
        Who wish to take advantage of the
        <strong>health/safety benefits of mobile devices</strong> (using a
        personal device is inherently safer than shared infrastructure).
    </li>
    <li>Who wish to reduce airport furniture requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="knowledge-prerequisites">Knowledge Prerequisites</h3>
<p>
    To effectively implement SITA Flex APIs in your application, it is assumed
    that you have:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong
                >Experience developing with cloud-based REST APIs and have
                extensive domain knowledge of airport and airline
                processes</strong
            >. Otherwise, you must acquire this knowledge prior to developing
            applications using SITA Flex APIs to use them effectively.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>General knowledge of the different</strong>
            <strong>peripheral types</strong> and they how they operate in
            airport.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Working knowledge of the</strong>
            <strong>IATA Technical Peripheral Specification</strong> that covers
            all devices in the airport and how to communicate with them.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>A familiarity with the old ways of printing such as</strong>
            <strong>pectabs</strong>, <strong>logos</strong>,
            <strong>templates</strong>, and associated print data covered in the
            legacy AEA Specification.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong
                >A familiarity the new ways of printing using PDFs and
                SVGs</strong
            >
            that are covered in the new IATA Technical Peripheral Specification.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>A strong idea of how your app should work</strong> prior to
            using SITA Flex.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>SITA can provide you the specifications listed through requests to:</p>

<h2 id="development-effortscope">Development Effort/Scope</h2>
<p>
    Seasoned developers who have 1)
    <strong>experience developing cloud-based apps</strong>, 2)
    <strong>extensive domain knowledge of airport processes</strong>, and 3) a
    <strong>clear idea of how their app will work</strong>, have a clear
    advantage for integrating SITA Flex APIs into their application more
    quickly.
</p>
<p>
    For developers that possess the traits above, but are a third-party
    developer instead of in-house, extra time for acquiring DCS access and other
    complications should be factored into the development scope and addressed
    early.
</p>
<p>
    For a developer that does not possess any, or only some of these traits,
    development effort is harder to assess and depends on the extent of the
    knowledge gap. If there is a knowledge gap, the developer must conduct
    thorough research to familiarize herself with airport processes. SITA will,
    however, provide as much guidance as is reasonably possible.
