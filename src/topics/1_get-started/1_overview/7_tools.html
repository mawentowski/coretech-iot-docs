<h2 id="recommended-tools">Recommended Tools</h2>
<p>The following tools are recommending for interacting with Flex.</p>
<h3 id="postman">Postman</h3>
<p>
    SITA provides a Postman collection that includes environment variables that
    store repeated information for efficiency.
</p>
<p>
    There are several blank variables you must fill in with your specific
    information. For example, <code>client_id</code> and
    <code>client_secret</code>. Other variables are included that do not require
    any changes.
</p>
<p>Use Postman to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Validate that your development kit is working as expected and that your
        code is behaving as expected.
    </li>
    <li>
        Copy code snippets and paste them into your application for testing and
        validation.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Download Postman here:

        >https://www.postman.com/downloads</a
    >.
</p>
<h3 id="json-web-tokens">JSON Web Tokens</h3>
<p>
    The SITA Flex Platform uses Bearer Tokens in the form of JSON Web Tokens
    (JWT). This is a standard that is defined in RFC 7519.
</p>
<p>
    Microsoft provides <a href="https://jwt.ms">jwt.ms</a> for free to debug
    JWTs received from the SITA Flex Platform to ensure you understand and can
    verify their contents.
</p>
<h3 id="base64">Base64</h3>
<p>
    <a href="https://base64.guru/">Base64</a> provides a range of encoders and
    decoders that can be used to translate data to-and-from Base64.
