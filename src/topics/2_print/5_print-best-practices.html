<p>
    It is recommended that your PDF documents are not too large, or else there
    will be a noticeable delay when printing. This is due to the current CPU
    processing limitations on the printers themselves, as the device needs to
    process the PDF data, format it, and make it ready for printing in hardware.
    Also, at present, PDF data will be sent over a virtual COM port which is
    rate limited.

    One way of reducing the size of your PDF is to reduce the DPI of the PDF
    document. This will shrink the data payload size but ensures elements are
    still legible.

    You should be targeting PDFs around the 10-20KB size. This should be enough
    to display the required document details. If you need assistance with this
    task, please contact

    Paper Stock Dimensions for PDFs/SVGs

    This may seem obvious but please ensure that your PDFs and SVGs match the
    paper stock dimension for entry passes and item tags at the area you are
    operating at.
