<h2 id="endpoints-2">Endpoints</h2>
<p>
    The end path for the GateAccess API starts with <strong>POST</strong>
    <code>/gateaccess/v2</code>, followed by the endpoint (i.e. action) for
    device to carry out.
</p>
<h3 id="post-gateaccessv2opengate">POST /gateaccess/v2/opengate</h3>
<p>
    Send a <code>/gateaccess/v2/opengate</code> request to initiate the boarding
    process. For a Self-Boarding Gate, the passenger is now allowed to proceed
    to scan their boarding pass. For Boarding Gate Readers, the agent scanning
    boarding passes is now ready to receive passengers in the queue.
</p>
<h3 id="post-gateaccessv2acceptpassenger">
    POST gateaccess/v2/acceptpassenger
</h3>
<p>
    Send a <code>gateaccess/v2/acceptpassenger</code> request to tell the
    GateAccess API that a passenger has boarded successfully. Send this request
    each time a passenger is processed successfully.
</p>
<h3 id="post-gateaccessv2rejectpassenger">
    POST /gateaccess/v2/rejectpassenger
</h3>
<p>
    Send a <code>/gateaccess/v2/rejectpassenger</code> request to tell the
    GateAccess API that a passenger is not allowed to board and must see an
    agent. Send this request each time a passenger is processed unsuccessfully.
</p>
<h3 id="post-gateaccessv2closegate">POST /gateaccess/v2/closegate</h3>
<p>
    Send a <code>/gateaccess/v2/closegate</code> request to end the boarding
    process. For a Self-Boarding Gate, this triggers the gate to close. For
    Boarding Gate Readers, this indicates the boarding process has ended and the
    agent scanning boarding passes will no longer do so unless the boarding
    process is initiated over again (<code>/gateaccess/v2/opengate</code>).
