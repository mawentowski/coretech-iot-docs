<h3 id="device-screen-messages">Device Screen Messages</h3>
<p>
    The GateAccess API does not recognize if a request is being sent to a
    Boarding Gate Reader or a Self-Boarding Gate. From the perspective of the
    API, these devices are the same. So, any <code>Message</code> can be passed
    in the Request Body, but whether or not the message displays depends on the
    device type.
</p>
<p>
    The <code>Message</code> passed by the airline in the Request Bodies of the
    <code>/gateaccess/v2/acceptpassenger</code> and
    <code>/gateaccess/v2/rejectpassenger</code> requests are meant to be
    messages for agents during an agent-driven boarding process using a Boarding
    Gate Reader. Since any boarding process involving a Self-Boarding Gate is a
    passenger-driven process, any <code>Message</code> passed to a SBG device is
    ignored.
</p>
<h3 id="receipt-data">Receipt Data</h3>
<p>
    Most Self-Boarding Gates, and some Boarding Gate Readers, have a receipt
    printer capable of receiving <code>ReceiptData</code> passed in the Request
    Body of a <code>/gateaccess/v2/acceptpassenger</code> request. The data must
    adhere to the AEA format for printing receipts.
</p>
<p>
    A scenario where this could apply is if a passenger scans their boarding
    pass at a Self-Boarding Gate and their seat has changed so their boarding
    pass does not show the correct seat. The printer prints a receipt indicating
    that their class has changed with their new seat number.
</p>
<p>
    The following is a sample Request Body of a
    <code>/gateaccess/v2/acceptpassenger</code> request that passes
    <code>ReceiptData</code> to be printed for the passenger.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-JSON">{
    &quot;ConnectionId&quot;: &quot;{{bgr_connection_id}}&quot;,
    &quot;CorrelationId&quot;: &quot;{{$guid}}&quot;,
    &quot;Message&quot;: [&quot;MSG Line 1&quot;, &quot;MSG Line 2&quot;],
    &quot;ReceiptData&quot;: {

    }

<p>
    It is important to note that a gate that prints a receipt only opens when
    the passenger has taken the receipt. If the passenger does not take the
    receipt, the gate will not open.
</p>
<h3 id="fraud-situations">Fraud Situations</h3>
<p>
    Self-Boarding Gates generate more Error-style messages because they have
    sensors that track passengers&#39; movements through the gate and generate
    errors depending on different fraud situations. The
    <em>IATA Technical Peripheral Specification (formerly AEA) Edition 2018</em>
    goes into elaborate detail of all the possible situations that could trigger
    an error, along with diagrams that illustrate the various positions of the
    passenger in relation to the boarding gate.
