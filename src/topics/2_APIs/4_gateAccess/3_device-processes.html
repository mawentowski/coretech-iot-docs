<p>
    The following is a summary of the boarding process when an agent uses a
    Boarding Gate Reader (BGR/BCR) to board passengers:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The agent overseeing the boarding process initiates boarding through a
        <code class="inline-code">/gateaccess/v2/opengate</code> request.
    </li>
    <li>An agent takes the boarding pass from the passenger and scans it.</li>
    <li>
        The airline backend determines if that passenger can be boarded and
        displays the result for the agent.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the passenger is accepted:
        <ul>
            <li>
                A
                <code class="inline-code">/gateaccess/v2/acceptpassenger</code>
                request is sent. A green light displays, along with any
                <code class="inline-code">Message</code> passed by the airline
                in the Request Body (e.g., &quot;Passenger Okay to Board&quot;).
            </li>
            <li>
                The agent gives the boarding pass back to the passenger, and the
                passenger is then allowed to pass the agent and board the
                flight.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        If the passenger is rejected:
        <ul>
            <li>
                A
                <code class="inline-code">/gateaccess/v2/rejectpassenger</code>
                request is sent. A red light displays, along with any message
                sent by the airline in the Request Body (e.g., &quot;Passenger
                Not Okay to Board&quot;).
            </li>
            <li>
                The message can specifically say the reason why the passenger
                was rejected or only provide a general reason.
            </li>
            <li>
                Depending on the situation, the passenger may be sent a
                different desk for an agent to investigate the situation
                further.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Once all passengers are boarding, the agent sends a
        <code class="inline-code">/gateaccess/v2/closegate</code> request that
        closes the boarding process.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="self-boarding-gate-process">Self-Boarding Gate Process</h3>
<p>
    The following is a summary of the boarding process when the passenger scans
    his or her boarding pass using at a Self-Boarding Gate.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The agent overseeing the boarding process initiates boarding through a
        <code class="inline-code">/gateaccess/v2/opengate</code> request.
    </li>
    <li>
        The gate display turns green to indicate it is ready to process
        passengers.
    </li>
    <li>The passenger scans his or her boarding pass at the SBG.</li>
    <li>The airline backend determines if that passenger can be boarded.</li>
    <li>
        If the passenger is accepted:
        <ul>
            <li>
                A
                <code class="inline-code">/gateaccess/v2/acceptpassenger</code>
                request is sent. The gate opens, and the display shows a green
                arrow indicating to the passenger they may pass through. The
                gate then closes behind the passenger.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        If the passenger is rejected:
        <ul>
            <li>
                A
                <code class="inline-code">/gateaccess/v2/rejectpassenger</code>
                request is sent. A red &quot;X&quot; displays, along with a
                message such as &quot;you cannot board, go see an agent&quot;.
            </li>
            <li>
                Depending on the situation, the passenger may be sent a
                different desk for an agent to investigate the situation
                further.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Once all passengers are boarding, the agent sends a
        <code class="inline-code">/gateaccess/v2/closegate</code> request that
        ends the boarding process.
    </li>
</ul>
