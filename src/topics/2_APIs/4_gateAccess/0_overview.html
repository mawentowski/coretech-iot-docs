<p>
    The <strong>GateAccess API</strong> endpoints allow your airline backend to
    interact with Boarding Gate Readers (BGR/BCR) and Self-Boarding Gates (SBG).

<p>The supported devices at present are the following:</p>

                process not involving a gate whereby the agent scans a
                passenger's boarding pass. If accepted, the passenger may move
                past the agent and board the flight.

                the acronym BCR is synonymous with BGR.

                process involving a gate whereby the passenger scans his or her

                passenger can pass through the gate.
