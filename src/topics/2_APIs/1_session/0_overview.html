<h1 id="session-api-1">Session API</h1>
<p>
    The <strong>Session API</strong> endpoints allow airline backends to connect
    to devices configured in a SITA Flex environment and to receive those
    messages on an Azure Service Bus subscription.
</p>
<p>The flow of the API is to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Reserve</strong> a location configured in the SITA Flex
            environment by sending a POST
            <code class="inline-code">/site/v2/reservations</code> request.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Subscribe</strong> to the Azure Service Bus subscription for
            your airline backend through a POST
            <code class="inline-code">/session/v2/subscriptions</code> request.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Get Location Capabilities</strong> through a POST
            <code class="inline-code">/site/v2/locations/{locationId}</code>
            request that returns list of devices at a location and their
            capabilities.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Create a <strong>connection</strong> to Flex devices to receive
            messages on the subscription through a POST
            <code class="inline-code">/session/v2/connections</code> request.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> The Get Location Capabilities endpoint (
        <code class="inline-code">/site/v2/locations/{locationId}</code>) is not
        serviced by the Session API. It is serviced by the Location API.
        However, it fits logically in the Session API flow at the time this
        documentation was written.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, note that the Reserve (
        <code class="inline-code">/site/v2/reservations</code>) and Get Location
        Capabilities endpoints both contain the
        <code class="inline-code">/site</code> in their end paths.
        <code class="inline-code">/site</code> is just a way of logically
        grouping these two endpoints and is not an API.
    </p>

<p>Example locations configured in the SITA Flex environment include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Airport CUTE type workstations for check-in and boarding</li>
    <li>CUSS Type devices like a Self-Service Kiosk</li>
    <li>Self-Service BagDrop and Self-Service Boarding Gate</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> When reserving a location, the
        <code class="inline-code">locationId</code> should not be confused with
        a workstation with peripherals physically connected to it. Rather, it is
        a logical entity that has certain capabilities associated with it.
