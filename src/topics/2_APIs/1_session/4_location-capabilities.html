    The <span class="method post">POST</span>
    <code class="inline-code">/site/v2/locations/{locationId}</code> request
    provides a way for airline backends to determine what devices are configured
    at a location and their capabilities.

        A successful request returns a

        Sample Response Body for <span class="method post">POST</span>
        <code class="inline-code">/site/v2/locations/</code> request containing
        device details at a location
    </h5>
    <h4 id="deviceid"><code class="inline-code">deviceId</code></h4>
    <p>
        The Response Body includes a
        <code class="inline-code">deviceId</code> for each device configured at
        a location.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code class="inline-code">deviceId</code> is comprised of the
        location (for example,
        <code class="inline-code">A-ZZU-MZUZUAIRPORT-ZZU1CKB004</code>),
        followed by the name of the device (for example,
        <code class="inline-code">.BGR1</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
        The airline backend then uses these IDs to connect to devices at the
        location. For example, to connect to an ATB through a POST
        <code class="inline-code">/session/v2/connections</code> request, you
        must pass the <code class="inline-code">DeviceId</code> in the Request
        Body.
    </p>
    <h4 id="capabilities"><code class="inline-code">capabilities</code></h4>
    <p>
        Many times, you can determine the capabilities of a device by simply
        looking at the <code class="inline-code">deviceId</code>. For example,
        the <code class="inline-code">ATB</code> device only has the capability
        to print a boarding pass. So, when a
        <code class="inline-code">deviceId</code> contains
        <code class="inline-code">.ATB</code>, it is assumed that device only
        has the <code class="inline-code">PrintBoardingPass</code> capability.
    </p>
    <pre> <code class="inline-code">{
    "deviceId": "A-ZZU-MZUZUAIRPORT-ZZU1CKB004.ATB1",
    "capabilities": [
     "PrintBoardingPass"
    ]
},
</code></pre>
    <h5
        id="sample-atb-device-whose-only-capability-is-to-print-a-boarding-pass"
    >
        Sample ATB Device whose only capability is to print a boarding pass
    </h5>
    <p>
        However, some devices have multiple capabilities. For example, a General
        Purpose Printer (GPP) may have both the capabilities
        <code class="inline-code">PrintBoardingPass</code> and
        <code class="inline-code">PrintBagTag</code>. Returning a list of
        devices is useful to an airline backend particularly in cases where
        devices at a location have multiple capabilities and can receive
        different kinds of requests.
