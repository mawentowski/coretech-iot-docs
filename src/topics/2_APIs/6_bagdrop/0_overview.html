<h1 id="bagdrop-api-1">Bagdrop API</h1>
<p>
    The <strong>Bagdrop</strong> <strong>API</strong> endpoints allow your
    airline backend to control a Self Bagdrop Unit to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        initiate a bag drop process to allow the passenger to place a bag on the
        belt.
    </li>
    <li>
        move the bag through the various positions of the bagdrop unit that
        correspond to the different stages of the bagdrop process.
    </li>
    <li>
        allow either the agent or the passenger to resolve any issues with the
        bag (depending on the situation).
    </li>
    <li>release the bag to the Baggage Handling System (BHS).</li>
</ul>
<p>The only supported device at present is the following:</p>
