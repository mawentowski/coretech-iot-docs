<p>
    It is recommended that your PDF documents are not too large, or else there
    will be a noticeable delay when printing. This is due to the current CPU
    processing limitations on the printers themselves, as the peripheral needs
    to process the PDF data, format it, and make it ready for printing in
    hardware. Also, at present, PDF data will be sent over a virtual COM port
    which is rate limited.
</p>
<p>
    One way of reducing the size of your PDF is to reduce the DPI of the PDF
    document. This will shrink the data payload size but ensures elements such
    as barcodes are still legible to allow BGR and LSR devices to read them.
</p>
<p>
    You should be targeting PDFs around the 10-20KB size. This should be enough
    to display the required document details. If you need assistance with this
    task, please contact

    Paper Stock Dimensions for PDFs/SVGs

<p>
    This may seem obvious but please ensure that your PDFs and SVGs match the
    paper stock dimension for boarding passes and bag tags at the airport you
    are operating at.
