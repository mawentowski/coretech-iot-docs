<h1 id="scan-messages-reference">Scan Messages Reference</h1>
<p>Service bus messages have a set of Message Properties (some built in, some custom) that assist you as the consumer in deserializing the Message Body of the message. The type of message (<code>MessageType</code>) determines how to deserialize the Message Body.</p>
<p>This section describes all possible <strong>Scan</strong> Service Bus messages, their properties, examples of successful/unsuccessful messages, and how to interpret errors. </p>
