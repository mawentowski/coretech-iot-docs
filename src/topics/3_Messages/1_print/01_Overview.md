# Print Messages Reference

Service bus messages have a set of Message Properties (some built in, some custom) that assist you as the consumer in deserializing the Message Body of the message. The type of message (`MessageType`) determines how to deserialize the Message Body.

This section describes all possible **Print** Service Bus messages, their properties, examples of successful/unsuccessful messages, and how to interpret errors.
